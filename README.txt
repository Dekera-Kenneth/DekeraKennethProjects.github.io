2. A prediction model for the people of the Gboko axis in which parameters like N-P-K, temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall are provided, and the model predicts suitable crops to be grown.

3. A customer churn prediction model (customers likely to leave a service or product). It uses machine learning techniques to predict the customer's churn based on historical data.
